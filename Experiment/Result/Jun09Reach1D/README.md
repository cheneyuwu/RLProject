## Environment configuration
- Single goal state
multiple initial position during training;
Relatively single initial position during demonstration generation.

## Check
- Effect of initialization of neural network on uncertainty
- Effect of expected Q value on uncertainty
- Use different reward structure to check the effect of learning from Q value directly.
