Meeting Summary\
July 8th, 2019


## Tasks
1. Figure out whether the action suggested by potential function makes sense
    - plots for action suggested by:
        - potential function
        - potential function + Q function
        - Q function
2. Figure out whether we can optimize through MAF
3. Figure out whether we can generalize this to multigoal environment
