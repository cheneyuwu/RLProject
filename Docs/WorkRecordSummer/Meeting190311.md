# Undergrad Research Project
Meeting Summary<br>
March 11th, 2019

## TODO before meeting
- Find a way to get $Q_D$ for Mujoco environments, this may help for generating useful demonstration data.
    - Its time horizon can either be finite or infinite.
    - You can do this by train a RL agent first and get demo data from that pre-trained RL agent.
- Supervised learning for demonstration. Use Edward for BNN or Ensemble.
  - Need to confirm with the loss function
  - Need to figure out how exactly edward layers works
- Code for comparing distributions.
  - This is done by assuming gaussian distribution and compare mean and variance. Should we do the same thing for Baysian NN?

## Command to run
- Run the demonstration part.
  

## Reminder
- UTEA Application Form has been submitted
