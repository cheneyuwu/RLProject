# RL + IL Research Project
Meeting Summary\
Aug 19th, 2019


## Tasks & Planning

1. Compare the performance of MAF, RealNVP, and WGAN with gradient penalty (put in experiments together with the following)
2. Try multiple starting positions without specifying the initial position (note: the goal should still be fixed)

## Experiments

- Aug 21
    - FetchMove
        - try this one with a different reward structure
    - FetchMoveAutoPlace
    - FetchPickAndPlace
        - Aug16FetchPickaAndPlaceNFGridSearch
            - Showed that reducing the capacity of maf helps, but real nvp never works
        - Aug19FetchPickAndPlaceNFGridSearch
            - Based on the previous grid search, do one more search and see if the result can be comparable with GAN or BC
- Aug 22
    - FetchPegInHole
        - Run with BC and GAN
    - FetchPickAndPlace
        - Run with BC and GAN
    - FetchMoveDense
        - Run with BC and GAN
