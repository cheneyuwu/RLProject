# RL + IL Research Project
Meeting Summary\
Sept 24th, 2019


## Tasks & Planning
- Starting by adding GAIL to existing work (people want a comparison to it)
- Have you considered or tried using just the imitation part of the reward function as a reward, without using any real reward signal at all?
    - Saw a paper out of Levine’s lab that was doing this (SQIL)
    - Wei-di already tried this out
- Have Yuchen or Florian seen “Reinforcement Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations”, or Normalized Actor Critic? Seems to be solving a similar problem.
    - Updates from Yuchen on progress with using images..happy to lend advice
